# Overview
I always wanted to learn Rust ever since it was released, but just never got the time / pet project to actually do. 
Now, inspired by the book [Optimizing Java: Practical techniques for improving JVM application performance](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Optimizing-Java-techniques-application-performance/dp/1492025798)
to learn more about JVM internals I found myself searching for JVM implementations in Rust and stumbled upon [Ben Evans' 
presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ECbwgkHdAE) from Devoxx conference 2019. It gave me enough information and motivation that I started this project.

With time, I'll add more features, documentation, test cases, etc.. The ultimate goal is to have a really simple, 
but working JVM that can execute most java programs, without too much concern on performance (at least in the first iteration).
